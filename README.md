# Math Text Parser

This script converts a text file containing math questions and answers into a JSON format. Each question along with its options, correct answer, and solution is parsed and structured into a JSON object.

## Description

The script `mathongo_task.py` reads a text file containing math questions and answers in a specific format. It extracts each question, its options, correct answer, and solution, and converts them into a JSON format. The JSON structure includes question number, question ID, question text, options, correct option, and solution text.

## Requirements

The script requires Python 3.x and the `re` and `json` modules, which are included in the Python Standard Library.
